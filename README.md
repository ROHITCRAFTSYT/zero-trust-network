> A comprehensive prototype implementation of a Zero Trust Network architecture using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) principles, built with Python, Mininet, and OpenFlow.

## üìñ Overview

This project implements a Zero Trust Network prototype that follows the "never trust, always verify" security model using Software-Defined Networking principles. Unlike traditional perimeter-based security, Zero Trust enforces strict verification for every network access request regardless of where it originates.

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Micro-segmentation**: Network divided into secure zones with distinct security policies
- ‚úÖ **Authentication for all connections**: No implicit trust based on network location
- ‚úÖ **Least privilege access**: Only necessary access rights are granted to authenticated entities
- ‚úÖ **Continuous verification**: Ongoing monitoring and validation of all connections
- ‚úÖ **Default-deny posture**: All access is denied unless explicitly permitted by policy
- ‚úÖ **SDN-based implementation**: Centralized policy enforcement using OpenFlow

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The prototype consists of:

1. **Mininet Network Topology**:
   - Trusted zone for internal resources
   - DMZ zone for externally accessible services
   - Untrusted zone for external entities
   - Core infrastructure with authentication and policy services

2. **Ryu SDN Controller**:
   - Zero Trust policy engine
   - Authentication verification
   - Continuous monitoring
   - Dynamic flow management

3. **Zero Trust Services**:
   - Authentication server (validates identities)
   - Policy server (determines access permissions)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Mininet 2.3.0+
- Ryu SDN Framework
- Open vSwitch with OpenFlow 1.3 support

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ROHITCRAFTSYT/zero-trust-network.git
cd zero-trust-network

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation
python zero_trust_test.py --skip-deps
```

### Running the Prototype

1. **Start the Ryu controller**:
   ```bash
   ryu-manager zero_trust_controller.py
   ```

2. **Create and run the network**:
   ```bash
   sudo python zero_trust_network.py
   ```

3. **Run the test suite**:
   ```bash
   sudo python zero_trust_test.py
   ```

## üß™ Testing the Zero Trust Implementation

The test script validates key Zero Trust principles:

- **Authentication verification**: Ensures all connections are authenticated
- **Policy enforcement**: Confirms access is granted only according to policy
- **Micro-segmentation**: Tests isolation between network segments
- **Default-deny behavior**: Verifies unauthorized connections are blocked
- **Continuous verification**: Tests periodic re-authentication requirements

   |   Hosts   |  |  Servers  |  |   Hosts   |
   +-----------+  +-----------+  +-----------+
```

### Zero Trust Controller Logic

1. **Default deny all traffic**
2. **Identify and authenticate source**
3. **Verify policy allows the access**
4. **Grant least privilege access**
5. **Monitor and log all activities**
6. **Time-limited access with re-authentication**

## üîê Security Considerations

- This is a **prototype** and requires additional hardening for production use
- Authentication mechanisms should be enhanced with MFA for production
- Policy rules should be regularly audited and updated
- Add encryption for all control plane communications
- Implement detailed logging and anomaly detection
